# RubyMotionBits

Just a few bits that I've played with or come across here and there.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I haven’t seen any posted release notes (the NEWS file in the **/Library/RubyMotion** installation folder) that are kept reasonably up to date, so I’ve also included the latest I have.  Since I only update OS versions every other year or so, it may get a little behind every now and then, but the current version as of this commit was 9.10.
